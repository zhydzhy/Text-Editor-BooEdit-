# Text-Editor-BooEdit-

A project from my ICS45C class, in the language of C++

features expected to see:

- A cursor displays the current position where we're editing
- The cursor can be moved around within the text using the keyboard
- Text typed into the editor is inserted at the point where we typed it
- Text can be deleted using a "backspace" key on the keyboard
- Every change made in the editor (cursor movements, changes to the text) can be undone with one keypress, and can be redone after being undone (in case you "undo" too far)
